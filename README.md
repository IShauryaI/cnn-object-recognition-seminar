**A Visual Computing seminar exploring Convolutional Neural Networks for object recognition and the Dynamic Dual-Processing framework inspired by brain mechanisms.**

## Executive Summary

This presentation examines the evolution of computer vision from traditional CNNs to modern hybrid approaches. The focus centers on the Dynamic Dual-Processing (DDP) framework by Zhang et al. (2023), which combines CNN local feature extraction with Transformer global context understanding. This brain-inspired approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS COCO dataset while maintaining computational efficiency, demonstrating 46% fewer FLOPs than comparable models while achieving similar accuracy.
